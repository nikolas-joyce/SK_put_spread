        		<p>This project will seek to construct, price, evaluate and roll a two legged ratio put back spread using the S&amp;P 500 Index Options traded on the CBOE.</p>
<p>The required set of postions for the required spread is driven by the following logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sell the 1 week ATM puts at the Friday open. With the proceeds of the short 1 week ATM put purchase 3 puts with at least 90 days to expiration in a deferred expiration cycle.</li>
<li>Roll the longer dated long put leg of the position if the S&amp;P 500 rallies suffciently to cause the OTM puts to move to &gt; = 15% OTM or roll the longer dated long put leg and the short dated, short put postions if the S&amp;P 500 declines sufficently to cause the OTM puts to become &gt; = 5% ITM.</li><div style="color: red"></div>
